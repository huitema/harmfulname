    <abstract>
        <t> 
Giving a host name to your computer and publishing it as you roam from
network to hot spot is the Internet equivalent of walking around with
a name tag affixed to your lapel. The practice can significantly compromise 
your privacy, and should stop.
        </t>
<t>
One possible remedy is to replace the static host names by frequently
changing randomized values. This idea obviously needs more work.
</t>
    </abstract>

<section title="Introduction">
<t>
There is a long established practice of giving names to computers. In the Internet
protocols, these names are referred to as "host names." Host names are used in a variety
of applications from file sharing to network management. They are typically
published as part of domain names, and can be obtained through a variety of
name lookups and discovery protocols.
</t>
<t>
Host names have to unique within the domain in which they are created. If the
domain is large enough, this uniqueness requirement means that the host name 
provides a lot of information on the device. It is not a world wide unique 
identifier, but it can be a veru good partial identifier.
</t>
<t>
The disclosure of information through host names creates a problem for
mobile devices. Adversaries that monitor a remote network such as a 
Wi-Fi hot spot can obtain the host name through passive or active monitoring 
of a variety of Internet protocols, such as for example DHCP, or multicast DNS.
They can correlate the host name with various other information extracted
form traffic analysis, and identify the device and its user.
</t>
<section title="Requirements">
<t>
The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
document, are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2026" />.
</t>
</section>
</section>
<section title="Naming practices">
<t>
There are many reasons to give names to computers. This is particularly true 
when computers operate on a network. Operating systems like Microsoft Windows or 
Unix assume that computers have a "host name." This enable users and 
administrators to ping a computer, add its name to an access control list,
remotely mount a computer disk, or connect to the computer through tools like
telnet or remote desktop.
</t>
<t>
In small networks, naming is pretty much left to the fancy of the user. Some will
pick names of planets or stars, other names of fruits or flowers, and other 
will pick whatever suits their mood when they unwrap the device. As long as users
are careful to not pick a name already in use on the same network, anything goes.
</t>
<t>
In large organizations, collisions are more likely and a more structured approach 
is necessary. In theory, organizations could use multiple DNS subdomains to ease
the pressure on uniqueness, but in practice many don't and insist on unqiue flat
names, if only not to advertise an internal structure to the outside world. To ensure
unique names, they will set naming guidelines and enforce some kind of structured 
naming. For example, within the Microsoft corporate network, computer names are
derived from the login name of the main user, leading to names like "huitema-test2"
for a machine that I use to test software.
</t>
<t>
There is less pressure to assign names to small devices, including for example
smart phones, as these devices typically do not enable sharing of their disks or
remote login. As a consequence, these devices often have manufacturer assigned
names, which vary from very generic like "Windows Phone" to completely unique 
like "BrandX-123456-7890-abcdef."
</t>
</section>
<section title="Partial identifiers" >
<t>
Suppose an adversary who wants to track the people login on a specific Wi-Fi hot spot,
for example in a railroad station. Assume that the adversary is able to
retrieve the host name used by a specific laptop. That, in itself, is
not enough to identify the laptop's owner. Suppose however that the
adversary observes that the laptop name is "huitema-laptop" and that the
laptop has established a VPN connection to the Microsoft corporate network. The two
pieces of information, put together, firmly point to Christian Huitema, employeed 
by Microsoft. The identification is successfull.
</t>
<t>
In the example, we saw a login name inside the host name, and that certainly helped 
identification. But generic names like "jupiter" or "rosebud" also provide
partial identification, especially if the adversary is capable of
maintaining a database recording among other information the site hostnames 
of laptops used by specific users. Generic names are picked from vocabularies that
include thousands of potential choices. Finding the name reduces the scope
of the search by maybe a factor thousand. Other information like the visited
sites will quickly complement that data and lead to user identification.
</t>
<t>
Of course, unqiue names assigned by manufacturers are even more interesting for 
ssuch adversaries. With a unique name like "BrandX-123456-7890-abcdef,"
identification can be pretty much immediate.
</t>
</section>
<section title="Protocols that leak host names" >
<t>
Many IETF protocols can leak the "host name" of a computer. A non exhaustive
list includes DHCP, DNS address to name resolution, Multicast DNS,
DNS service discovery, and Link-local Multicast Name Resolution.
</t>

<section title="DHCP" >
<t>
Shortly after connecting to a new network, a host use DHCP <xref target="RFC2131" />
to acquire an IPv4 address and other parameters <xref target="RFC2132" />. DHCP
query can disclose the "host name." DHCP traffic is sent to multicast addresses
and can be easily monitored, enabling adversaries to discover the host name 
associated with a computer visiting a particular network.
</t>
<t>
The problem with the host names and FQDN parameters in DHCP are analysed  
in <xref target = "I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcp-privacy" /> and <xref target="I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-privacy" />.
Possible mitigation is described in <xref target="I-D.huitema-dhc-anonymity-profile" />.
</t>
</section>

<section title="DNS address to name resolution" >
<t>
The domain name service design 
<xref target = "RFC1035" /> includes the specification of the special domain
"in-addr.arpa" for documenting the name of the computer using a particular IPv4 
address, using the PTR format defined in  <xref target="RFC1033" />. A similar
domain, "ip6.arpa", is defined in <xref target="RFC3596" /> for finding the name of a 
computer using a specific IPv6 address.
</t>
<t>
Adversaries who observe a particular address in use on a specific network
can try to retrieve the PTR record associated with that address, and thus
the host name of the computer, or even the fully qualified domain name of
that computer. The retrieval may not be useful in many IPv4 networks due
to the prevalence of NAT, but it could work in IPv6 networks.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Multicast DNS" >
<t>
Multicast DNS (MDNS) is defined in <xref target="RFC6762" />. It enables hosts to
send DNS queries over a multicast port, and to elicit responses from hosts
partipating in the service.
</t>
<t>
If an adversary
suspects that a particular host is present on a network, the adversary can 
send issue MDNS or LLMNR requests to find, for example, the A or AAAA 
records associated with the host name in the ".local" domain. A positive
reply will confirm the presence of the host.
</t>
<t>
According to the MDNS specification, when a responder starts it must send a set of
multicast queries to verify that the name that it advertises are unique on the network,
and also to populate the caches of other MDNS hosts.
Adversaries can monitor this traffic and discover the host name of computers
as they join the monitored network.
</t>
</section>

<section title="DNS service discovery" >
<t>
DNS-Based Service discovery (DNS-SD) is described in <xref target="RFC6763" />. It enables
participating host to retrieve the location of services proposed by other hosts. It can
be used with DNS servers, or in conjunction with MDNS in a server less environment.
</t>
<t>
Participating hosts publish a service described by an "instance name," typically 
chosen by the user responsible for the publication. While this is obviously
an active disclosure of information, privacy aspects are mitigated by user control. 
Services are only published when deciding to do so, and the information disclosed in
the service name is well under the control of the device's owner. 
</t>
<t>
In theory there should not be any privacy issue, but in practice the publiction of
a service also forces the publication of the host name, due to a chain of dependencies.
The service name is used to publish a PTR record announcing the service. The PTR record 
typically points to the service name in the local domain. The service names, in turn,
are used to publish TXT records describing service parameters, and SRV records 
describing the service location.
</t>
<t>
SRV records are described in <xref target="RFC2782" />. Each record contains 4 parameters:
priority, weight, port number and host name. While the service name published in the PTR
record is chosen by the user, the "host name" in the SRV record is indeed the host name
of the device.
</t>
<t>
Adversaries can monitor the MDNS traffic associated with DNS-SD and retrieve the host
name of computers advertising any service with DNS-SD.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Link-local Multicast Name Resolution" >
<t>
The Link-local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) is defined in <xref target="RFC4795" />. 
The specification did not achieve consensus as an IETF standard, but is widely 
implemented. Like MDNS, it enables hosts to send DNS queries over a multicast port,
and to elicit responses from computers implementing the LLMNR service.
</t>
<t>
Like MDNS, LLMNR can be used by adversaries to confirm the presence on
a network of a specific host, by issuing a multicast requests to find
the A or AAAA records associated with the host name in the ".local" domain. 
</t>
<t>
When an LLMNR responder starts it must send a set of
multicast queries to verify that the name that it advertises are unique on the network.
Adversaries can monitor this traffic and discover the host name of computers
as they join the monitored network.
</t>
</section>
</section>

<section title="Randomized Host Names as a remedy" >
<t>
There are three ways to remedy the host name practices. We could instruct 
people to just turn off any protocol that leaks host names, at least when
they visit some "insecure" place. We could also examine each particular
standard that publishes host names, and somehow fix the corresponding 
protocols. Or, we could attempt to revise the way our devices manage
the host name parameter.
</t>
<t>
There is a lot of merit in "turning off unneeded protocol when visiting
insecure places." This amounts to attack surface reduction, and is
clearly beneficial. However, there are two issues with this advice. First, it
relies on recognizing which network are secure or insecure. This is hard to
automate, while relying on the user judgement may not always provide good 
results. Second, some protocols like DHCP cannot be turned off, which
limits the value of this option.
</t>
<t>
It may be possible in many cases to examine a protocol and
prevent it from leaking host names. This is for example what is attempted for
DHCP in <xref target="I-D.huitema-dhc-anonymity-profile" />. However, 
it is unclear that we can identify, revisit an fix all the protocols
that publish host names.
</t>
<t>
We may be able to mitigate most of the effects of host name leakage by
revisiting the way our platforms handle host names. This is in a way similar to 
the approach of MAC address randomization described in 
<xref target="I-D.huitema-dhc-anonymity-profile" />. Let's assume that the
operating system, at the time of connecting to a new network, picks
a random host name and start publicizing that random name through the
internal "get host name" API. Protocols like DHCP or MDNS will publish
that randomized host name instead of the static value. This will
frustrate monitoring by adversaries, without preventing protocols
liek DNS SD from operating as expected.
</t>
<t>
Obviously, further studies are required before the idea of randomized host names
can be implemented.
